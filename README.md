# Mobile-Cloud-Computing-Project
A RESTful web service developed for the "Mobile Cloud Computing" course at the "Aalto University" in Espoo.


The goal of the course was developing a complete web service and then deploying it on a OpenStack machine (provided by the Aalto University).
First step was: developing a backend. The choice was free but we chose the suggested technologies: NodeJS and MongoDB.
We followed the current trend that is using Non-Relational Databases.
